    "\n",
    "1. We make descioson based on gut-feelinv\n",
    "2. Our decsion are informed by available data\n",
    "3. We measure the impact of our descison\n",
    "4. We formulate our beliefs as hypothesis before measuring\n",
    "5. We organizar our hypothese intot a belief system \n",

    "#### How do they measure the impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "They run A/B-test on the basic level. \n",
    "\n",
    "A/B test we espoase the two groups to an experience identifical experiences and then if we observe a significant difference between the two we can determine that the differenbce between the experience caused that divergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example you can have one design and then you have another design. Then you compare if people behave anyt differently. \n",

    "To know if a change is significant we need enough users\n",

    "To understand WHY we need to use qualitative data is nuanced and rich of dertails and it'll tpically help us form new hypotheses about why certain things are happening. \n",
